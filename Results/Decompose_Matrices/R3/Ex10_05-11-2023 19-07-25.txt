decompose the next matrix (3*3 size):
4 ,24 ,-32
24 ,144 ,-192
-32 ,-192 ,256

M = 
4 ,24 ,-32
24 ,144 ,-192
-32 ,-192 ,256

find L and L' by decomposition of M:
transform M matrix to L' by an upper ranking:
R2 --> R2 - 6*R1

4 ,24 ,-32
0 ,0 ,0
-32 ,-192 ,256

R3 --> R3 + 8*R1

4 ,24 ,-32
0 ,0 ,0
0 ,0 ,0

R1 --> 0.5*R1

2 ,12 ,-16
0 ,0 ,0
0 ,0 ,0

L = 
2 ,0 ,0
12 ,0 ,0
-16 ,0 ,0

L' = 
2 ,12 ,-16
0 ,0 ,0
0 ,0 ,0
