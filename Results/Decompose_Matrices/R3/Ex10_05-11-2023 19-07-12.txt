decompose the next matrix (3*3 size):
4 ,24 ,-32
24 ,144 ,-192
-32 ,-192 ,256

M = 
4 ,24 ,-32
24 ,144 ,-192
-32 ,-192 ,256

find L, D and L' by decomposition of M:
transform M matrix to L' by an upper ranking:
R2 --> R2 - 6*R1

4 ,24 ,-32
0 ,0 ,0
-32 ,-192 ,256

R3 --> R3 + 8*R1

4 ,24 ,-32
0 ,0 ,0
0 ,0 ,0

R1 --> 0.25*R1

1 ,6 ,-8
0 ,0 ,0
0 ,0 ,0

L = 
1 ,0 ,0
6 ,1 ,0
-8 ,0 ,1

D = 
4 ,0 ,0
0 ,0 ,0
0 ,0 ,0

L' = 
1 ,6 ,-8
0 ,1 ,0
