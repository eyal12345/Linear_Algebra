solve the next system in R2 space (2 equations)(2 unknowns):
eq1: +   x1 - 3*x2  = 5
eq2: +   x1 + 2*x2  = -5

1 ,-3 | 5
1 ,2 | -5

implement the solution by ranking rows method:
transform A matrix to I by a ranking rows:
R2 --> R2 - R1

1 ,-3 | 5
0 ,5 | -10

R2 --> 0.2*R2

1 ,-3 | 5
0 ,1 | -2

R1 --> R1 + 3*R2

1 ,0 | -1
0 ,1 | -2

exist a single solution in R2 space for the system which is:
x = (-1 ,-2)
