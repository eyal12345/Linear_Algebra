solve the next system in R2 space (2 equations)(2 unknowns):
eq1: +   x1 - 3*x2  = 5
eq2: +   x1 - 3*x2  = -2

1 ,-3 | 5
1 ,-3 | -2

implement the solution by elementary matrices method:
transform A matrix to I by an elementary matrices:
R2 --> R2 - R1

1 ,-3 | 5
0 ,0 | -7

does not an exists solutions
