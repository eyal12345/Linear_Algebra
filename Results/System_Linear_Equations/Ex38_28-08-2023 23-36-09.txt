solve the next system in R3 space (3 equations)(3 unknowns):
eq1:                       = 0
eq2:                       = 0
eq3:                       = 1

0 ,0 ,0 | 0
0 ,0 ,0 | 0
0 ,0 ,0 | 1

implement the solution by ranking rows method:
transform A matrix to I by a ranking rows:
does not an exists solutions
