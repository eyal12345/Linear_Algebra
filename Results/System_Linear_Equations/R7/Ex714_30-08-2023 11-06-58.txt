define a new column in the vector b when x2 is a free variable in R7 space:
1 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 | 0 ,0
0 ,1 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 | 0 ,1
0 ,0 ,1 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 | 0 ,0
0 ,0 ,0 ,1 ,0 ,0 ,0 | 0 ,0
0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,1 ,0 ,0 | 0 ,0
0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,1 ,0 | 0 ,0
0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,1 | 0 ,0

the solution is an infinite set of vectors in R7 space which are linearly dependents in the vector space:
x = λ*(0 ,1 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0) when λ it's a free scalar that belongs to the R set
