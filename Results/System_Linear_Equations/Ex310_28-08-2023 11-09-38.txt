solve the next equation in R1 space (3 equations)(1 unknown):
eq1: x = 2
eq2: 2x = 4
eq3: 3x = 6

1 | 2
2 | 4
3 | 6

implement the solution by elementary matrices method:
transform A matrix to I by an elementary matrices:
R2 --> R2 - 2*R1

1 | 2
0 | 0
3 | 6

delete the zero row from the system:
1 | 2
3 | 6

R2 --> R2 - 3*R1

1 | 2
0 | 0

delete the zero row from the system:
1 | 2

exist a single solution in R1 space for the system which is:
x = 2
