solve the next equation in R1 space (3 equations)(1 unknown):
eq1: x = 1
eq2: 2x = 2
eq3: 3x = 3

1 | 1
2 | 2
3 | 3

implement the solution by elementary matrices method:
transform A matrix to I by elementary matrices:
R2 --> R2 - 2*R1

1 | 1
0 | 0
3 | 3

delete the zero row from the system:
1 | 1
3 | 3

R2 --> R2 - 3*R1

1 | 1
0 | 0

delete the zero row from the system:
1 | 1

exist a single solution in R1 space for the system which is:
x = 1
