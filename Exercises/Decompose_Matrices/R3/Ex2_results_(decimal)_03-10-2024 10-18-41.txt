decompose the next matrix (3*3 size):
2 ,1 ,0
6 ,0 ,4
-8 ,5 ,0

M = 
2 ,1 ,0
6 ,0 ,4
-8 ,5 ,0

find L and U by decomposition of M:
transform M matrix to U by an upper ranking:
R2 --> R2 - 3*R1

2 ,1 ,0
0 ,-3 ,4
-8 ,5 ,0

R3 --> R3 + 4*R1

2 ,1 ,0
0 ,-3 ,4
0 ,9 ,0

R3 --> R3 + 3*R2

2 ,1 ,0
0 ,-3 ,4
0 ,0 ,12

L = 
1 ,0 ,0
3 ,1 ,0
-4 ,-3 ,1

U = 
2 ,1 ,0
0 ,-3 ,4
0 ,0 ,12
