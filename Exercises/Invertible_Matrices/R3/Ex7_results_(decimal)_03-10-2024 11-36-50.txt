invert the next matrix (3*3 size):
0 ,0 ,0
2 ,3 ,5
1 ,3 ,6

0 ,0 ,0 | 1 ,0 ,0
2 ,3 ,5 | 0 ,1 ,0
1 ,3 ,6 | 0 ,0 ,1

implement the solution by ranking rows method:
transform M matrix to I by a parallel ranking:
R1 <--> R2

2 ,3 ,5 | 0 ,1 ,0
0 ,0 ,0 | 1 ,0 ,0
1 ,3 ,6 | 0 ,0 ,1

this is singular matrix
